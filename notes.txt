An interesting tidbit from the SEC Consult article.
"Note: The password hash of the “default” user is “OxhlwSG8” (stored in /mtd/Config/Account1).
The hash algorithm was reverse engineered before and is implemented on GitHub ( https://github.com/tothi/pwn-hisilicon-dvr/blob/master/sofia_hash.py ).
Basically, it is a result of MD5(password) and compressed even further.
For complex passwords it should be more efficient to find a hash collision than to crack the password.
Interestingly, the same hash algorithm is used in products from Dahua Technology.
Possibly Xiongmai copied from Dahua or the hash algorithm is part of the Huawei HiSilicon SoC SDK both vendors use?"
